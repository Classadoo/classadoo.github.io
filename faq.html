	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Who are your teachers?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			Our teachers are all passionate educators, who work or have worked at some of the biggest names in tech: Twitter, SpaceX, Uber, Google and more. Check out our <a href="teachers.html">teachers page</a> for more info.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What is pricing like?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We generally charge $25 per student, per week for class sizes 10 and larger, and $30 for classes smaller than 10. For this we provide one hour long group session, homework (for some courses), and some availability for remote help in between sessions. However we're happy to set up introductory pricing if you'd like to try out a course. Just contact us at <a href="mailto:learn@classadoo.com">learn@classadoo.com</a>!

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What is the structure of a course?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We usually teach one hour long, live, remote, group session per week, for each course. Then our instructors are available between classes for remote help. Their responsiveness varies, but most teachers will respond to email questions the same day, and are often avaible for 1:1 chats. Most of the Level II and above courses include projects which students work on between classes. If you'd prefer a different structure (more or fewer classes per week, more or less homework), just email <a href="mailto:learn@classadoo.com">learn@classadoo.com</a>, and we'll design a course that meets your needs!

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What does a classadoo session look like?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			Our sessions look very similar to to a normal class you might take in school, except the teacher is on a screen, instead of being there in person. So all you need is a room with internet, a screen you can connect to a computer, and space and a computer for each student. We always have a live adult in the classroom for supervision as well. If you cannot easily provide an adult for each session, then we will hire one.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Do students work together?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We think collaboration is one of the most important skills we can teach, so we frequently have students solve problems in groups. Most sessions have at least one group task, and most classes will include at least one group project that students work on over multiple sessions.
		</div>
	</div>	

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Do all the students need to be there in person?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			Yes, right now our sessions are the same as a normal class, but with a remote teacher. So all students need to be in the same room, for each session. However, if you are interested in taking a course, but don't know of any other interested students in your area, just email us! We'll work on organizing a class for you.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			How did Classadoo start?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			David, our CEO, and one of our teachers, previously founded the nonprofit <a href="http://schoolshaped.org">School Shaped</a>, along with Ari, another one of our teachers. While working on School Shaped David and Ari visited many schools, and talked to many teachers. They found that classes, especially coding classes, often lacked context. After all, code is just a means to an end, not an end itself. We wanted to enable kids to do what we had done: use code to pursue their passions, whatever those were. So we combined our previous experience building computer science curriculum with our practical experience working for big name and startup tech companies, to create courses which engage students with practical, hands on lessons, and help them become <i>creators</i> not <i>coders<i>.
